These notebooks and CSV files come from a Udemy course: 

'Data Science for Business: 6 Real World Case Studies'

This repository covers the following 4 case studies:

1. Human Resources Department

3. Sales Department

4. Public Relations Department

The end of the case studies are marked by 'EXCELLENT JOB!'. Up until this point I have carried out writing and understanding the code with the instructor of the course. After this point I have found ways to optimize the code and improve model performance.
